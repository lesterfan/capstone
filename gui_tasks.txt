1. Make the UI more clear (explain parameters) and aesthetic (colors/display)
2. Add options for different graph shapes (Euclidean, network)
3a. Add an option for inputting range of values and running multiple tests (e.g. "k=3:5")
3b. Maybe make a plot of the resulting time?
4. Have it speed up / time out if takes too long. (e.g. double speed every 30 sec of real time)
5. How to represent nodes on graph clearly? Need four colors for nodes and two for travelers.

You have a dataword of size k, which will correspond to a codeword of size m by adding redundancy, which you want to covertly send through the coupon collection procedure. You do this by working on a connected graph of size s, in which you have f friends. 
The disseminator will give m out of the f friends a bit each of the codeword to send the message.
The collector will need to visit any k out of the m people the disseminator visited in order to receive the message.
We are interested in the expected time before the collector will have received the message.
